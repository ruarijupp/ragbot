Early recovery can feel overwhelming. Some tips include:  

- Build a daily routine to provide structure and stability.  
- Engage with peer support groups (such as AA or SMART Recovery).  
- Avoid high-risk situations in early stages.  
- Focus on nutrition, sleep, and exercise â€” physical well-being supports mental recovery.  
- Practice patience: Recovery is a process, not an event.  
- Seek professional counseling when needed.  
- Celebrate small wins and milestones.  

Remember: progress, not perfection.
