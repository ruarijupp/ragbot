Managing cravings is an important part of recovery.  
Here are common strategies:  

- Recognize triggers: People, places, or emotions that lead to cravings.  
- Delay: Cravings often pass within 10–15 minutes if you can delay taking action.  
- Distract: Engage in another activity, such as calling a friend, taking a walk, or practicing mindfulness.  
- Deep breathing: Calm the body’s stress response.  
- Seek support: Connect with a sponsor, counselor, or peer support group.  

Remember, cravings are a normal part of recovery — they do not mean failure.
